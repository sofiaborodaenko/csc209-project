Write a small program to use scanf to read two values from standard input. The first is a
is a 10 character string and the second is an integer. The program takes no command-line arguments.

If the integer is -1, the program prints the full string to stdout. If the integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive
the program prints only the corresponding digit from the string to stdout. In both of these cases the
program returns 0. If the integer is less than -1 or greater than 9, the program prints the message "ERROR"
to stdout and returns 1.
